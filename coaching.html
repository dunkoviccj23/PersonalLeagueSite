        <p>
            Are you getting tired of being in Iron? Are your friends all skyrocketing up the ladder and you're stuck
            in elo hell for what seems like an eternity? Well hey, you came to the right place! I offer a lot of help
            in many different ways! Ranging from simply advice to real time, in game coaching.<br><br>

            Prices for these services can definitely vary depending on your circumstances, time needed, current rank,
            etc. But below is what I can offer, anything else will have to be discussed on a case to case basis.
            <ul>
            <li>In game, real time coaching. I will spectate your game as you play and provide criticism and coaching before and after games.</li>
            <li>VOD reviews. We can watch some of your recent recordings together or separate, and I will document and record tips and tricks for future games.</li>
            <li>Specific champ/micro/macro advice only. This one consists of just basically a Q&A without game reviews.</li>
            </ul>

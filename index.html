            Hi, my name is Cory Dunkovich aka "GodlyBeastcake". League of Legends has been a huge passion, and
            pastime of mine for the past 10 years. When I first started playing I was sitting at the bottom of the
            barrel at Bronze 4. However, just like anything else, with a lot practice, elbow grease, and luck I
            was able to achieve Diamond 3 (POGGERS) at my peak. I have a pretty diverse champion pool, but I am
            primarily a Zed main. Honestly though, my friends and I are pretty casual players, and all are comical
            weirdos which adds great commentary to the games. But don't worry we have our fair share of flashy plays
            thrown in here and there. I hope you enjoy the content!<br><br>
            Please feel free to check out my clips and videos in the 'Media' tab!<br><br>
            If you're looking to climb and need a nudge in the right direction take a peek at the 'Coaching' tab!<br><br>
            Lastly, if you're just looking for someone to play with, or have any questions, comments or feedback,
            I'd love to hear from you! Please reach out via the 'Contact' tab!<br><br>
            Happy ganking, Summoners!
        </p>
